Final User: The final user of my CV page will probably someone from the human's resources departmen from som company, or anyone who needs to hire someone to do some kind of work related to software applications.
In my CV they are expected to find information about me, including a general overview of who I am, what I'm able to do (my skills), which languages I know and some extra information about what I like. Furthermore, if after reading my CV they are interested in hiring me or they want to know more before making a decision, they can also find my phone number and my email so that they can contact me.



Information architecture: This project has only one page, which means that it wouldn't make sense to analyse its architecture. There's only an html file and a css file. There's also a PNG image of me. 



Visual design: I decided to use different tonalities of blue. I specifically used #04395b for the main header of the page, #6189a3 for the top right side filler, #add9e6 for the part where I give different information about me, and #176596 for my contact details.
I decided to use this blue palette in part because blue is my favourite color, but also because I think that blue transmits a serious and calm feeling, which I believe is important when you are trying to get a job. Another reason is that I'm and UdG student, so blue is the perfect color to represent that. Finally, I chose this tonalities because I feel like they combine well with each other and it's easy to read text on them.

Regarding the font, I decided to use different sizes and decorations such as bold and underlined text to represent different sections in the CV. I also used black for the more text-heavy part, and white for the shorter sections. I used sans-serif because I like it, it's easy to read, and again, this CV is supposed to be a tool to get someone to hire me, so I'm trying to be a bit formal. What I mean is that sans-serif is a pretty standard font, perfect for this "serious" CV.

Finally, for the page layout i decided to structure my page in three main parts (plus one filler, only for aesthetic purposes). The first one is the main header. This will probably be the first part you are going to see because it's at the top of the page, it's bigger and there is also an image there. I think it's important that whoever reads this CV knows who I am in the first place. Then, the next information the reader is supposed to find is the general overview about me so that they know what I'm doing at the moment, my interests, my skills... etc. Lastly, once they have read everything (or at least a bit) they might want to contact me, so that's what they will find at the end, my contact details.
So, this page follows the Z layout that we talked about in class.
